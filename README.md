# LLM-based-intent-recognition

## Overview

This project demonstrates an application of large language models (LLM) for intent recognition in conversational AI. The application parses user inputs, identifies their intents, and responds accordingly. The intents are predefined within the application, allowing for modular and scalable management of various conversational intents.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Intent Recognition**
    - **Informative Intent**: Triggered when the user asks for specific information or facts.
    - **Empathetic Intent**: Triggered when the user shares personal feelings, concerns, or experiences.
    - **Task-Oriented Intent**: Triggered when the user wants to accomplish a specific task.
    - **Other Intents**: Triggered when the intent is not among informative, empathetic, or task-oriented.

2. **Message Handling**
    - Saves user inputs and assistant responses to maintain conversation history.
    - Responds dynamically based on identified intents.

3. **Predefined Intents**
    - Intents are defined directly within the code, with robust descriptions and examples for each intent type.

4. **Modularity**
    - The application is structured in a modular way to allow easy addition of new intents and functionalities.
